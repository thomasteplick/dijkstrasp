# dijkstrasp
Find the shortest path (SP) between a source vertex and a target vertex in an acyclic graph using the Dijkstra algorithm
This program is a web application that uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between a source vertex and
a target vertex.  The program can be used by addressing the web browser to http://localhost:8080/graphoptions.  The 
program generates 2-500 vertices in a Euclidean graph that is specified by the user.  The minimum spanning tree (MST) is
generated using the Prim algorithm and is displayed.  The user can choose the start vertex and end vertex for the 
shortest path calculation.  The MST distance and the SP distance are shown.
